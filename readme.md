A small project that shows how to write a shared Mithril component that can be used by Mithril 0.2 and 1.x applications

Here is the project structure :
* [component.js](component.js): the shared component
* [0.2.html](0.2.html): a simple Mithril 0.2 application that uses the component
* [1.x.html](1.x.html): a simple Mithril 1.x application that uses the component
